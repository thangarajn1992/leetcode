# Leetcode

This repository is to document leetcode problems and their explanations and solution. At present, the solutions will be in C++. As and when I learn other languages, will update the code with those languages as well.

For now my solution will be based on CPP. Later I may plan to add solution on other languages as well.

Lets learn and create more!!
